# eslint-custom-rules

This repository includes an eslint rule that detects any kind of reference to [MC Hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Hammer). For the sake of simplicity, I've only included commenting rules and function declaration rules.

## How to test

Run `yarn test` and see the magic happens. The test suite included valid and invalid use cases.
